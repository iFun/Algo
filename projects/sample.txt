What I learned from PHIL145 will help me identify created scientific controversy in the future. 

I think It is important for me and the public to have a critical thinking skills. Companies and 

Media are using created scientific controversy to fulfill their motivation. Children died 

because their parents believe vaccines causes autism. People died in hunger because their 

leader believe GMO food are bad for health. Since I cannot be a expert in every fields, I chose 

to believe in the majority of the scientific community.
